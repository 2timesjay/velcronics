      <b>Shattered Sword: The Untold Story of the Battle of Midway</b>
      <div>
        Clearly intended for someone better-versed in existing narratives 
        about the Battle of Midway, and more generally about the Pacific War, 
        than I am, but nonetheless full of interesting tidbits. Excellent at
        connecting the smallest details of carrier operation to the flow of the
        larger battle as a whole - "for want of faster flight deck elevators, 
        the Empire was lost". Also convinced me that man was neither meant 
        to fly through the air nor sail on the sea, and certainly not to do 
        both at the same time, as naval aviators do.
