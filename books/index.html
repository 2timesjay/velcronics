      <b>Shattered Sword: The Untold Story of the Battle of Midway</b>
      <div>
        Clearly intended for someone better-versed in existing narratives 
        about the Battle of Midway, and more generally about the Pacific War, 
        than I am, but nonetheless full of interesting tidbits. Excellent at
        connecting the smallest details of carrier operation to the flow of the
        larger battle as a whole - "for want of faster flight deck elevators, 
        the Empire was lost". Also convinced me that man was neither meant 
        to fly through the air nor sail on the sea, and certainly not to do 
        both at the same time, as naval aviators do.

      <b>Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went to War in 1914</b>
      <div>
        A fascinating and detailed mostly-diplomatic history of the causes of WW1. 
        While Franz Ferdinand's assassination by the Black Hand (an organization that 
        the author convincingly links to Serbia's government) was the direct cause of 
        war, the author Christopher Clark dives into the web of alliances - alliances 
        built by clever and aggressive men seeking their nations' interests - that 
        deliberately inflamed a regional conflict into the devastating continental 
        conflagration that it became.
        
        It seems to me to be a classic story of clever ambitious men with ingenious plans 
        who simply couldn't keep control of what they started, resulting in monumental tragedy.
